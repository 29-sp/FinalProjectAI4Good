            <p>Our team, comprised of six dedicated individuals from diverse backgrounds across North America, has embarked on a mission to address a pressing issue in our society: the food allocation problem. Recognizing the importance of providing affordable and accessible food options, we have designed a project that leverages machine learning to offer users more cost-effective choices of food available in their vicinity. Our innovative platform not only helps users find affordable groceries but also enriches their culinary experiences by providing a wide array of international recipes. By integrating recipe suggestions with corresponding grocery lists, we aim to simplify the cooking process and promote cultural diversity in cuisine. Our project is a testament to our commitment to using technology for social good and making a positive impact on the community.</p>
