## Project: Food Insecurity

### Dataset
This dataset features 16,277 everyday grocery items scraped from three prominent chains: No Frills, The Real Canadian Superstore, and Save On Foods, key players in British Columbia's grocery market. It offers a broad spectrum of products, ranging from standard essentials to specialty items, including halal, vegetarian, vegan, and kosher options. This diverse compilation provides valuable insights into consumer preferences and trends within the grocery industry, making it a rich resource for analysis and exploration.
### Pre-data Processing 
The raw datasets obtained through web scraping are meticulously processed using the Python libraries pandas and numpy. This processing includes segregating the data into four distinct CSV files corresponding to the store origin: Save On Foods, Superstore, No Frills, and a combined file that aggregates the data from all sources.Each dataset comprises the following columns: Title, Price, Category, Store, Price per Unit, Per Unit Quantity, and Unit Type.
